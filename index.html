		<h4 class="w3-center">Introduction</h4>
		<p>Social media has become the main source of easily accessible and digestible information for field experts and organizations to publicly spread news, but at the same time it has become a place where individuals can spread their beliefs as fact and influence others’ opinions on subjects that readers have yet to be informed about. As the internet is a place open for anyone to share information, the validity of information presented is not always guaranteed to be accurate or benevolent.</p>
		<p>For our research on Political Popularity of Misinformation, we want to research the influence politicians have on Twitter, a well known social media platform for users to voice their opinions to a wider audience. The information shared on Twitter that we are interested in will be grouped into scientific information or conspiracy information. We have chosen ten politicians to represent our scientific group and another ten politicians to represent our misinformation group.  Politicians can easily sway public opinion with a simple tweet, therefore we wanted to analyze how much they can influence other Twitter users with their tweets.  This specific analysis is interesting because we are able to determine whether a politician’s tweet has influence on the public based on tweet engagement and a politician’s growth on Twitter.</p>

				<h4 class="w3-center">Ratios</h4>
				<p>To analyze reception to a particular tweet, we chose to use the concept of ratios or “getting ratioed” on Twitter. For our analysis, we define the ratio of an individual tweet to be two times the number of replies to the number of likes and retweets a tweet receives.</p> 
				<p style="text-align: center;">\(\dfrac{2 * \#\:of\:replies}{\#\:of\:likes + \#\:of\:retweets}\)</p> 
				<p>Ratios allow for a quantitative way to measure how controversial a tweet is, with higher ratios signaling a more disputed tweet. We weigh replies more heavily than likes and retweets due to the increased amount of effort it takes to write out a reply to a tweet as opposed to liking or retweeting that same tweet.</p>

		<!-- Maxes -->
		<div id="maxes" class="w3-container w3-padding-32 w3-theme-l4">
		<h4 class="w3-center">Rolling and Cumulative Maxes</h4>
		<p>For the rolling and cumulative maximum methods, we analyze a politician’s number of likes and retweets over the span of their months active on Twitter.  The purpose of these metrics are to analyze a politician’s growth over time using the given information from each tweet.</p>
		<p>The rolling maximum value is used to determine the number of likes or retweets for a politician over a specified window.  For example, if we view Bernie Sander’s rolling maximum over twelve months with a window size of 20, we are able to see his growth over the twelve months with the days grouped into sizes of 20.  Each day he tweets, the maximum number of tweets for that day is extracted and we continue this process for each day.</p>
		<p>The purpose for the cumulative maximum method is to view the cumulative likes and retweets over a politician’s time period on Twitter.  The difference for this method is that there is no window to be specified.  We take the cumulative maximum of tweets for a day and strictly use this number.  This helps measure the cumulative growth over the months of activity.</p>

				<h4 class="w3-center">Permutations</h4>
				<p>A permutation test takes in two samples and determines the chance that the samples come from the same distribution.  For our research, we compare the distributions between our two groups with the following null and alternative hypothesis:</p>
				<p>Null Hypothesis: The growth of likes for our misinformation group is the same as the growth for our scientific group over each year.</p>
				<p>Alternative Hypothesis: The growth of likes for our misinformation group will be different from our scientific group over each year.</p>
				<p>We normalize the growth of likes for each year by calculating the percentage growth from their previous year.  The permutation test shows how each group grew from year to year.  This helps show the significant years and compares the growth of our scientific group to our misinformation group.</p>

		<!-- Analysis -->
		<div id="results" class="w3-container w3-padding-16 w3-theme-l4">
			<h4 class="w3-center">Results</h4>
			<p>As a result of our investigation, we found that politicians who spread misinformation often have a higher ratio value and less overall likes per tweet.  This higher ratio value means that these politicians are more likely to spread controversial information on Twitter.  This also shows that people who are viewing their tweets on Twitter are engaging in the politicians' tweets by commenting more compared to liking or retweeting.</p>
			<p>In contrast, we see that politicians who spread scientific information on Twitter have lower ratios and significantly more likes on their tweets.  This is interesting to note because it shows a clear distinction and result between our two groups.</p>
			<p>When comparing the two groups, we see that our scientific group has been steadily increasing in growth over the years while our misinformation group has only been growing significantly in the past recent years.</p>
			<p>The overall result of our research shows that a politician has the most growth through spreading non-controversial, scientific information because this yields a steady growth over time in comparison to spreading controversial information.</p>
